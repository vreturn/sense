_"These people are stupid"_ - J

### People are the worst

If you're people you're the worst. Doesn't matter how good you think you are you're still shit. You've still made mistakes. Hurt people, induced negativity in the world.

There's no way to quantify how much, but it's a non-zero value.

I try not to worry about the mistakes and actions of people.

I do try to remember the mistakes and actions of people.

How you define people in your mind affects _who they are_ in real life.

Disagreement about identity tends to lead to psychosis, from what I've observed.

Who is psychotic seems _not_ up for discussion.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

It doesn't ultimately matter.

The only thing that matters is trying to do good.

Because people _can't_ know how much bad they've done.
