_"But are you happy?"_ - F

### Remember?

Remembering actions is difficult for me. Remembering how to do things. Or what things are. Emotion, etc.

It's best to do things to remember how to do things.

But sometimes I forget that I need to do things in order to remember how to do things.

Then I end up in a state of not knowing that I don't know the effects/results of an action.

Forgetting the concept of the action or interaction.

Forgetting the concept of existence.

Forgetting the concept of emotion.

Never remembering is trading instantly forgetting to never forget.

Having _any_ self esteem is infinitely different than having _no_ self esteem.

The set of values between 0.00001 and 0 is infinite.

### [Laziness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization)

It's a function of attempting to exist optimally.

If something doesn't offer feedback/results modify or remove until forgotten.

Continuously move on.

Don't evaluate things already evaluated.

Evaluate _just in time_.

Don't do things that aren't productive (in any sense of the word).

Don't have fun.

Don't enjoy life.

Don't _want_ to be alive.
